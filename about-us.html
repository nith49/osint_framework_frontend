        <p>I'm Manoj, and I have worked as an Intern at Hacker4Help. I have been fortunate enough to work on two crucial aspects of this project: searching for top-notch OSINT tools through meticulous research and collaboration, and contributing to the backend development of the website. I believe that access to quality OSINT tools should be convenient and user-friendly, and this website is designed with that ethos in mind. </p>
